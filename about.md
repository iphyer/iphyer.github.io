### Information about Me

I am a graduate student of CS & MSE in UW-Madison. I am currently trying to use state-of-the-art deep learning models like Faster R-CNN, YOLO, GAN to study interesting material problems, e.g., how to use GAN to accelerate the generation of STEM images.

This site is a blog that records my personal thinking and exciting things I want to share.

Enjoy, and have fun!
