## Forwords

Following the last post, I will continue to summarize key points of Chapter 4 in this blog.\

Nearly all supervised learning projects can be divided into 3 parts,

> predict, compare, learn

so chapter 3 focus on predicting part and chapter will focus on comparing and learning.

## Chapter 4

The benefits of transfer learning:
Transfer learning needs less training data
Transfer learning makes the learned model generalizes better
Transfer learning makes training process less brittle
Transfer learning makes deep learning easier
